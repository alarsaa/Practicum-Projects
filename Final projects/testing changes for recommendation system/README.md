# A/B Testing- testing changes for recommendation system

Task statement
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

our goal will be to finish the analytical task for the A/B tests.
the purpose of this project is to check if testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system.

the project includes visits from 07-12-2020 through 01-01-2021
to finish our test correctly we need to check the data if we have any duplicates, or missing values.
also we need to check deeply the users in the tests to find out if we can rely on the results of the tests
and then we will use the z-criterion to check the statistical difference between the proportions.
