# Practicum-Projects

Goals of the study :
the purpose of this project is to take an insight into what kind of books people read, who are the most famous authors, the most dominant publishing house, how many users are attractive, and How often they share their opinions on books. this information could help us to land in this industry with more powerful steps. we can make our decisions based on data. I would do more research on Google or any other platforms, and try to find more information like which genres/authors people prefer, and if there are any trends that can help us get more sales in our app
