# Product Range Analysis Final Project

Task Decompostion: our goal for this project to analyze product range for e-commerce, in this project we will mark the most profitable items in the store. according to Pareto Principle states that 80 percent of revenue comes from 20 percent of products in the store. that could help the company to focus in the strong selling products, and where they should pay attintion more, maybe the less selling products are low quality and because of that customers not getting back to buy them.

Data overview and preprocessing
overview data
deal with missing values and identify duplicate data
transform data from one type to another
checking the distribution of correlation matrix and check if we have outliers
categorize products. (according to the column StockCode we have 4070 items)
checking the most relevant data - maybe what was trendy product few months ago and now is not trendy anymore
Analyze Products
the main task here to investigate deeply the selling of our product:

create revenue column for each transaction ( item price x quantatie)
calculate the revenue for each category and report the most selling category and less selling category
calculate how much we sell from each category
Average inventory sold per day per category
Create a products dataset: include orders number, quantity and total revenue
calculate the average amount of purchases among the time
divide customers into segments according to average amount of money they spent in the store
search for seasonal period that we had a peek in total purchase.
check what the most common shopping cart consist of
Formulate and test statistical hypotheses
do the data show that the 80/20 “rule” perfectly apply to products in this dataset?
is there any seasonal perieod that we should pay attention to it the next year?
do we need to check and foucs more on the 'weak' products in the store?
do we need to work more in our relationship with specific segment of customers?
should we make bundled products that customers tend to buy them together?

Matrics
1.Pareto Chart for Products categories
2.Monthly Sales Growth
3.Revenue per category = total revenue for category / average category sold for period
4.What is the average purchase size?
