# analyzing user behavior

the purpose of the project is to test the hypotheses that will help us to learn about the performance of two groups 246 and 247 that they are the control groups and the 248 the test group our first steps will be:

we will study the sales funnel.
Find out how users reach the purchase stage.
How many users actually make it to this stage?
How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular
second. we are going to analyze the A/A/B test
How many users are there in each group?
We have two control groups in the A/A test, where we check our mechanisms and calculations. See if there is a statistically significant difference between samples 246 and 247.
Compare the results with the combined results for the control groups.
