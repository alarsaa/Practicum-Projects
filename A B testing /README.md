A/B Testing project:

in this project together with the marketing department, we will compile a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue
the purpose of the project is to test the hypotheses that will help us to learn about the performance of two groups A and B. 
first of all ,we are going to analyze the A/B test
then we will continue to calculate the cumulative revenue for each group and then to compare the groups
and also we want to calculate the cumulative average order size by group and then to compare the groups.

we will check if we have outliers to make sure that the difference between the groups didn't come from the outliers.
then we will find the statistical significance for each metrics we calculated
