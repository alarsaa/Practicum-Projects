# Which one is a better plan?
The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. 
The commercial department wants us to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

I'm going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. 
I have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. 
my job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

the purpose of the project to test 2 hypotheses about which of the plans brings in more revenue we will use the data to test the hypotheses
Test two hypotheses:
the average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf calling plans equal.
the average revenue from users in the NY-NJ area is different from that of the users from the other regions
