# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

the project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. 
we need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. 
The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

the report will be considered when building the credit score of a potential customer. The credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

the purpose of the project to test 4 hypotheses about the bank's customers to form recommedation to build a credit scoring model we will use the data to test the hypotheses about the relationship between a certain customer characteristic and his possible dely in loan pyment Test four hypotheses:

1.the ability to repay a loan depends on the family's number of kids.
2.marital status affects repaying a loan on time.
3.The level of income predicts a proper loan repayment.
4.loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment
